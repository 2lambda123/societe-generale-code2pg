# FILES AND LANGUAGES TO ANALYZE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# code2pg needs to know which file to analyze and the corresponding language.
# For now, one type of extension can be analyzed at a time

# Example (only .sql files will be analyzed and the language will be plsql):
# extension = sql
# language  = plsql
