How to contribute?
==================

Installation
------------

You have to fork this repository to your own repo.
Make sure that you have the prerequisites installed (Perl modules).

Contributing Code
-----------------

To contribute follow Git Flow guidelines : [Git Flow Cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).

in a nutshell :
- create a new branch on your forked repo
- push your commits into that branch
- open your fork in github.com
- create a PR based on this new branch.

Since your repo is a forked repo github will create a pull request on the societe-generale repository
and then it's our job to review it and merge it !

Keeping your fork in sync with societe-generale repo
please refer to those 2 documents :
